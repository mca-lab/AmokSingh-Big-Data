# Big Data Project: Climate & Agriculture Correlation Analysis

## Project Overview

A big data pipeline analyzing the relationship between climate factors and agricultural productivity across countries using Python and Docker.

**Research Question:** "How do climate factors (temperature, precipitation) correlate with agricultural productivity and food security indicators across different countries?"

## Module 1: Data Collection & Ingestion - COMPLETED

### What We Accomplished

- Built Docker container for reproducible data collection
- Created realistic sample datasets for climate and agriculture analysis
- Generated two comprehensive datasets:
  - **Climate Data**: 1,035 records
  - **Agriculture Data**: 345 records
- Data covers 15 countries from 2000-2022
- Solved Docker and dependency compatibility issues
